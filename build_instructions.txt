This is how I build it from inside the v8 directory.  Not very useful verbatim, but good for figuring something out based on your environmetn

// how I build under OS X
clang++ -std=c++14 -I/users/xaxxon/v8  sample.cpp -o h2 /users/xaxxon/v8/out/x64.release/{libv8_base.a,libv8_libbase.a,libicudata.a,libicuuc.a,libicui18n.a,libv8_base.a,libv8_external_snapshot.a,libv8_libplatform.a}




// This is how I have to build it under ubuntu
// remember, library order matters.   Things that depend on a symbol come before
//   things that resolve the symbol (important for libicu*.a)
g++ -std=c++14 -I/home/xaxxon/v8  sample.cpp -o h2 /home/xaxxon/v8/out/native/obj.target/tools/gyp/{libv8_base.a,libv8_libbase.a,libv8_base.a,libv8_external_snapshot.a,libv8_libplatform.a} /home/xaxxon/v8/out/native/obj.target/third_party/icu/libicu*.a /home/xaxxon/v8/out/native/obj.target/third_party/icu/{libicui18n.a,libicuuc.a,libicudata.a} -lpthread -ldl 


hint: Don't forget to copy in the v8 .bin files, too.





how to build v8:

git clone depot_tools and add it to your PATH

https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-depot-tools



get v8 using depot tools:

https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/Using%20Git

(may want to run gclient sync to update a failed fetch)

run "make native"

and then wait a long time
