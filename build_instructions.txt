This is how I build it from inside the v8 directory.  Not very useful verbatim, but good for figuring something out based on your environmetn

clang++ -std=c++14 -I/users/xaxxon/v8  sample.cpp -o h2 /users/xaxxon/v8/out/x64.release/{libv8_base.a,libv8_libbase.a,libicudata.a,libicuuc.a,libicui18n.a,libv8_base.a,libv8_external_snapshot.a,libv8_libplatform.a}


hint: Don't forget to copy in the v8 .bin files, too.
