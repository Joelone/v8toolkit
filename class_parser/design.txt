ast_action.h/cpp
PrintFunctionNamesAction : PluginASTAction
 - This is what is registered with clang


ast_consumer.h
ASTConsumer:
 - sets up matchers to define what data is of interest
 - binds different sets of data with a string name
 - specifies a class to be used for processing the matcher matches
  - ClassHandler


class_handler.h
ClassHandler : MatchFinder::MatchCallback
Two phases - build up data structures with all relevant data then
  a second phase to dump that data to appropriate output files

 - run() callback called for each matcher match (basically called once for each class)
  - builds up data structure of LOTS of things, many will not be present in the output files

 - onEndOfTranslationUnit() called after every match has been handled
  - uses all the built-up data structures to generate the js stub, bindings, and bidirectional types


OutputModule:

All classes that should be wrapped are sent to OutputModule

OutputStreamProvider provides output stream for any header/footer data to be written that is not class-specific

Classes are run through Criteria object to select only classes intended to be written by this OutputModule
