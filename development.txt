bidirectional Factory objects need to be wrapped so they can be used from javascript, not just have their objects
passed back from c++ helpers

Debugging support - looks like there are packages out there for integrating it with chrome for debugging



Building with gn:
fresh computer:
fetch v8

existing computer:
rm -rf v8
gclient sync (from $HOME)


No support for pointer to l/r-value ref qualified member function


Need to change debugging to use v8's built-in debugging



ClassParser:
-------------

js-api.js file still uses c++ syntax for specifying default values - need to convert them

bidirectional class files don't have the right includes, including JSWrapper

Need to figure out how to properly get which virtual methods are associated with a bidirectional type
 - get ones that aren't directly in parent type
 - don't repeat ones that are in multiple parent/grandparent/etc types
 - need a set of name and parameter strings corresponding to each one most likely



need to get data members from the entire class hierarchy for wrapped classes.
