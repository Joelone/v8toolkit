bidirectional Factory objects need to be wrapped so they can be used from javascript, not just have their objects
passed back from c++ helpers

Debugging support - looks like there are packages out there for integrating it with chrome for debugging



Building with gn:
fresh computer:
fetch v8

existing computer:
rm -rf v8
gclient sync (from $HOME)


No support for pointer to l/r-value ref qualified member function


Need to change debugging to use v8's built-in debugging


detect default parameters in c++ and use them in the javascript callbacks

add default parameter text to js-api stubs:
 * @param {string} [somebody=John Doe] - Somebody's name.

 make tools/CMakeLists.txt file build clang library

 change class_parser to build up and use ParsedMethod objects instead of current way
