bidirectional Factory objects need to be wrapped so they can be used from javascript, not just have their objects
passed back from c++ helpers

Debugging support - looks like there are packages out there for integrating it with chrome for debugging



Building with gn:
fresh computer:
fetch v8

existing computer:
rm -rf v8
gclient sync (from $HOME)


No support for pointer to l/r-value ref qualified member function


Need to change debugging to use v8's built-in debugging



ClassParser:
-------------

finish rework on binding generation

finish rework on bidirectional generation

js-api.js file still uses c++ syntax for specifying default values - need to convert them
